Currently, I am a Graduate Assistant at FIU’s Biostatistics Department, where I engage in teaching and research on advanced statistical methods and R programming. My expertise spans various statistical software and programming languages including R and SAS, and I am skilled in reproducible reporting with tools like Rmarkdown and Quarto.
